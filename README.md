Modal Logic-Based Intelligent Agents

The purpose of this thesis was to study Modal logic and examine its syntax and semantics. Furthermore critical part of this thesis was the observation of the different subfields, according to the basic systems of axioms and ‘modalities’. Two applications were developed, based on the ‘Blocks World’, using the SWI-Prolog platform as a tool to apply the axioms and the operators which are defined by the BDI and Cohen & Levesque frameworks.
